#Multi-Processing
#Threads get shared memory as they are inside Process, but Process are separate , So Processes have their OWN MEMORY.
#So when there are multiple processes(multiprocessing) then we use queue, so basically everytime in process we use queue


#In the below code , we'll check the speed of computation in threads vs process ,
#Process code takes less time, while here , the memory is getting mixed up and they are getting called simultaneously,
#so not accurate results in the below code.

#thread code
