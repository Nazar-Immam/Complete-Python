#Concurrency and Parallelism

Concurrency - Doing Multiple tasks at the same time, cpu switches between processes to do different tasks, 
tasks that's taking time cpu shifts to next task and complete the previous one after this or just switching one to other
 Concurrency is done by ,
1. threading.Thread
2. asyncio


Parallelism - It just means doing multiple tasks at the exact same time, python use multiple cores of cpu for this
This is like two people doing two tasks at the same time
Parralelism is done by, 
1. multiprocessing.Process
2. concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor



Functions don’t “automatically” run in threads.
By default, everything runs in the main thread.
When you create a thread (Thread(...) + .start()), you’re telling the OS: “Run this function in a separate thread.”
After that, the OS takes care of scheduling those threads on CPU cores.
