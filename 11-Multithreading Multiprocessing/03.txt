Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

When two or more threads are trying to access and change the same memory at the same time , this is 
called race conditon.
To avoid this, gil puts a mutex on the thread that reaches first, and now with mutex(type of lock) on
that memory ,no other thread can access it until the mutex gets off from the thread and then moves 
to next thread accessing it


threading.current_thread() tells you which thread is currently executing that piece of code.
