Best practices for Pydantic Model Design 

1.Model Organization
-- Define Leaf models first(The last model, model with no dependencies)
-- Build Upward - Gradually compose more complex models(from easier to medium to difficult)
-- Use Clear naming - Make relationships obvious
-- Group Related Models - Keep models in logical modules

2. Performance Considerations
-- Deep nesting impacts performance - Keep reasonable depth
-- Be precaucious in Recursive models , they can really really be very memory exhaustive.
-- Be careful of Circular References.
-- Lazy Loading - Avoid using computated models, it takes space in ram and reduces cpu speed.

3. Data Modelling Tips
-- Model real world relationships - Mirror your domain structure
-- Use optional as much as possible - Not all relationships are required
-- Consider using Union Types - For polymorphic relationships
-- Validate Business Rules - Use model validators for cross-model logic
