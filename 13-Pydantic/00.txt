Pydantic - 
Pydantic is a Python library used for DATA VALIDATION and SETTINGS MANAGEMENT using Python type hints. 
In simple words, it helps you ensure that the data your program receives or uses is correct and
structured properly.
General Usecases:
-Data parsing and validation 
-API development
-gives clear errors
-config management 
-Data serialization/deserialization

Also Pydantic automatically checks that the data matches these types and can also convert 
compatible types (e.g., a string "123" to an integer 123).

Think of Pydantic as a guard that ensures the data in your Python program is
always safe, clean, and properly typed
