Async Python.

Concepts-
-- async def functionname():   |aysnc in start of the funciton declares a 'coroutine'
       pass                    |coroutine is a special function that can be paused.

    
-- await  - without async you cannot use await , await pauses the execution until the result is ready

-- asyncio - asyncio is a Build in Libraray,lets Python run multiple tasks "at the same time" (concurrently)
without threads/processes, by smartly switching between them whenever one is waiting.

-- EventLoop - This is the engine that runs and schedule co-routines in python.(same as JS)


Blocking code     -    time.sleep(2)
Non-Blocking code -    await asyncio.sleep(2)
