Debugging , Profiling - Race Conditions and Deadlock in Python.

Profiling = There are some python tools, by which we can profile our code. When we profile code
it shows us that how much time is spent on each function of our code. It tells that where our 
main thread spent most time on which functions, and based on that we can optimise our functions.
to do this, write in terminal = 'python -m cProfile -s time file_name'
