#Deamon and Non-Deamon Threads

 1. Daemon Threads
 A daemon thread is a background thread.(used for non-critical tasks, like cleanup,monitoring,etc)
 The Python interpreter will not wait for it to finish.
 If only daemon threads are left running, the program will exit immediately.

 2. Normal (Non-daemon) Threads
 By default, every thread you create is a non-daemon thread.
 Non-daemon threads keep the program alive until they finish.
 The Python interpreter will wait for them to complete before exiting.


But if we use t.join() , then no matter deamon or non-deamon, the program will wait till end.
